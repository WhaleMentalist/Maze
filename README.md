# Maze
  Side project that constructs random mazes using recursive backtracking algorithm. It also shows the generation of the maze cell-by-cell on the display using color coding. The light 'teal' color represents the cell in the 'stack' of the recursive algorithm. The 'green' color represents that the cell was popped from the 'stack'. In the future, I also will add additional maze generation algorithms with the same color coding schemes to visiualize how the algorithm constructs the maze.

  I plan to implement AI that will solve the maze using a genetic algorithm. I am aware that there are path finding algorithms that are well suited for the problem. I simply want to see if a genetic algorithm converges to a solution quickly.
